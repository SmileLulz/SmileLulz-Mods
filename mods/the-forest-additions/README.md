## **The Forest Additions** mod adds some nice things from the game [The Forest](https://endnightgames.com/games/the-forest)
### Features:
- Chop/cut Zombies' parts after killing them. (Use Axe).
- Cook and eat Zombies' Arms & Legs on hard times.
- Parts can only be cooked on Smoker and Campfires.
- There will be small chances to getting poison effect for a short time after eating cooked zombie parts (arms, legs).
- Non-cooked zombie parts (arms, legs) will always give you poison effect for a short time.

Some plans are already made for future updates.
