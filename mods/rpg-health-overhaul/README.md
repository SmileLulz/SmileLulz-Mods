(This mod is Remake of my original mod [RPG Health System](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rpg-health-system) that is discontinued due to codes/workspace loss.)
## Elevate your Minecraft survival journey with the RPG Health Overhaul mod. This mod introduces a couple of features:
- **Post-Sleeping Health :** After a good night's sleep, your character health will regenerate a bit and also have 50% chance of providing you bonus health, making mornings a fresh start. Just keep in mind that your hunger level will also drop a little, so keep an eye on your food level.
- **Post-Sleeping Hunger :** After waking up, your character hunger bar will decrease a little bit, making the game a bit realistic.
- **Life Crystals :** Life Crystals permanently increases your max health upto 40 (20 Hearts). Life Crystal are generated in underground between y0 to y-63 in big open caves and can also be rarely found on cave tunnels.
- **Recommended Mods for better experience :** [Campfire Regen](/mods/campfire-regen/) , [Heart Lantern](/mods/heart-lantern/)
- **Recommended ResourcePack :** Heart Crystal Remodel ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/heart-crystal-remodel)) ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/health-crystal-remodel))
